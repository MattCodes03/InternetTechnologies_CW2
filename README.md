Coursework 2 for Internet Technologies Module

## Scenario
Your employer is a software house that has been invited to submit a tender for the provision of web
services to support a job site for a client company.
Your company is keen that a solution for a job site which will have a generic pattern which can be
easily applied to other potential customers.
You may design a site to support fictional client company or organisation of your own choice and use
this as a model for your design documentation and your proof-of-concept site.

The job site documentation will require as a minimum: A description of the scope and context of the
fictional client, descriptions of job activities and recruitment requirements, the ability for applicant
to submit their details and administrator role to maintain the job site.
The client could be based on any area of corporate recruitment, hospitality, local authorities, shops,
manufacturing sectors or others. However, though it is always valuable to make something useful,
interaction with a real client is outside the scope of the module assessment.
You should review a range of job sites at different scales to suggest ideas for your own site.
Your boss is keen to get a site specification as an internal document with a proof-of-concept site
which could be shown to potential clients.
